January 23rd.

I always want to remember that night.

Driving into an unknown and dead downtown;
turning down into a lane of empty on-coming traffic
in search of ink for your bones.

City lights dim and I can almost feel the pulse
of civilization dying into a whisper.

Red walls and a damaged shop but the beards,
ink and humour make us feel at home in
a whole new world.

You are smiling straight from in the inside.
The sun set hours ago but now,
it’s in your smile.

Inside of a hive,
guns buzzing.

There’s ink on your bones,
small changes but a new energy.
A reminder now always in the
twist of a wrist.

I always want to remember that night,
electric and new.
